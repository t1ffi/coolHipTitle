## Reservation Data Analysis Project Questionnaire

### Project Data Points
1. Across all reservation partners for January & February, how many completed reservations occurred?
	

	Assuming this question is asking for how many reservations were made across both partners for January and February, there was a total of 200 reservations made. 
	If this question is referring to the total completed reservations that were followed through, then 70 reservations from clubready were followed through + 85 from mindbody = 155 total completed reservations.
	Upon clarification in our email thread, I would say that my second portion of this answer is correct with 155 total Peerfitters following through 


2. Which studio has the highest rate of reservation abandonment (did not cancel but did not check-in)?


	32 from mindbody & 32 from clubready = both studios have an equal reservation abandonment rate


3. Which fitness area (i.e., tag) has the highest number of completed reservations for February?

4. How many members completed at least 1 reservation and had no more than 1 cancelled reservation in January?

5. At what time of day do most users book classes? Attend classes? (Morning = 7-11 AM, Afternoon = 12-4 PM, Evening = 5-10 PM)

6. How many confirmed completed reservations did the member (ID) with the most reserved classes in February have?

7. Write a query that unions the `mindbody_reservations` table and `clubready_reservations` table as cleanly as possible.





### Project Discussion
1. What opportunities do you see to improve data storage and standardization for these datasets?


	They were very comprehensive and succinct, but my recommendation for improving these datasets is to create uniform column titles since it was difficult to coordinate the tables with different names (i.e. canceled_at vs. canceled; t vs. NULL, check_in_at vs. signed_in_at).


2. What forecasting opportunities do you see with a dataset like this and why?


	Although business intelligence uses and analyzes historical data to create reports and dashboards of the past, it is essential to utilize these past data trends to make proper decisions for the future. I see a dataset like this giving Peerfit a more accurate sales pitch to future studio partnerships with precise stats to cite. When a salesperson proposes the idea of Peerfit to a Yoga studio through the lens of gaining more customers, they would cite how Peerfitters clearly pursue Yoga more than other activites. This way the company would see a boost in class sales if they were to partner with Peerfit to receive a boost from the bulk of the clients who enjoy Yoga.


3. What other data would you propose we gather to make reporting/forecasting more robust and why?


	I would recommend collecting other data such as email, class cost more specific class tag's for quick access, connection, and analysis. Using the class costs, one would be able to accurately forecast the increase in prices per studio according to the rate of change from past data.
